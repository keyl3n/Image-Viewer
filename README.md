# Image-Viewer
A small little app I made to open and view images.

Nothing much, I just wanted to learn how to use file dialogs.

## Known bugs
* Image viewer will use a lot of RAM after viewing a lot of images without being restarted.
* Some files with very rectangular aspect ratios will show up in the app very small.
* App will crash if the file dialog is closed without the user selecting an image.
